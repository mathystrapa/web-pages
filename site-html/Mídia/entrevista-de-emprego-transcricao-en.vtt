partnership with DR And today, oh, I'm

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.920
going to pull your ear, but I'm also going
to give you a little kiss Because we're

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.400
going to talk about what to do and what
not to do in job interviews Because I want

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.580
you, once and for all, my people, to
stop paying for micro interviews Agreed?

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.660
Then come with me!

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.420
Hello, welcome to the interview.

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.260
I would like you to start by
telling us a little about yourself.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.640
Ok, I am a nice, cheerful, high spirits
person My parents always said that I am

10
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.080
very intelligent And in addition, very
special And I agree with them, of course

11
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.240
Well, I am a person who I am very
committed To my personal and professional

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.760
development I really like to study to
improve myself I am graduated in marketing

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.920
with extension and people management which
by the way is my passion Even my

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.300
professional goals they are linked
to education and development.

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.880
Of people Well, let's talk now about your

16
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.780
professional experiences Why did
you leave your last company?

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.160
Look, I left because it was hell working
there I was always arguing with my boss He

18
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.560
kept demanding a lot of absurd things from
me And he only gave promotions to those

19
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.960
who pulled his strings Yeah, exactly, I'm
not a puller and I wasn't obliged to put

20
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.930
up with this horrible situation So, do
you know what I did to get sent away?

21
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.560
I started missing work, I started doing

22
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.640
everything wrong and It worked out because
of conflicts of values and lack of

23
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.060
communication, because this company there
had a work system that I was not used to.

24
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.560
I tried to adapt, I tried to talk, to

25
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.080
answer questions, to make a more strategic
alignment, but unfortunately they did not

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.620
have the culture of giving
this openness to employees.

27
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.490
So, unfortunately, our
partnership there ended.

28
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.570
I see here on your resume that you
spent some time without work, right?

29
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.380
What did you do during that time?

30
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.840
Look, I really tried, I didn't go to hire

31
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.600
in the market, but it was impossible You
know, the crisis in Brazil, a horrible

32
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.560
thing And the companies, they don't like
me because I sent a resume to all of them

33
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.280
None gave me any feedback HR is also to
blame because you only hire people who

34
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.940
have IQ That's not fair,
it wasn't my fault!

35
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.720
In the meantime I tried to take advantage
of the time to develop professionally

36
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.220
Because the crisis really
affected me a little bit, right?

37
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.800
It delayed my return to the labor market a

38
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.400
little bit So I tried to read books, I
tried to take courses Mainly distance

39
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.720
courses So I could really have a more
attractive curriculum And now I'm

40
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.100
returning to the market,
much more prepared.

41
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.420
How interesting And what
are your career goals?

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.360
Look, my biggest professional goal is to
be hired by a company that pays me very

43
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.360
well, that gives me many benefits and
especially that I appreciate the fact that

44
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.120
I am working with it I want to continue
developing professionally, improving

45
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.160
myself, because obviously I am interested
in growing my career Even to be able to

46
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.320
contribute more, not only to my team, but
to my company Another thing I really want

47
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.260
to do is teach classes,
especially in colleges.

48
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.140
It is important to prepare new
professionals for the future.

49
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.600
I want you to tell me now what
your strengths AND weaknesses are.

50
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.960
Ah, weak point is easy I'm very
perfectionist You don't understand Because

51
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.020
I'm very demanding I'm very
responsible, I'm very committed.

52
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.220
Even too much.
Now, strong point, let me think.

53
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.180
Ah, so, I know I'm going to sound
repetitive, but it's perfectionist too.

54
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.180
Because, well, I like perfection.
That's it.

55
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.100
Regarding my weakness, I would
say that I am very anxious.

56
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.880
This has already harmed me for some time

57
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.610
in my professional life, but today
I am aware of why I get so anxious.

58
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.240
Usually when things are very important to
me, or when I'm waiting for good news, or

59
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.780
waiting for a good result,
I end up getting anxious.

60
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.300
So today what do I do?

61
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.860
I try to focus on the present moment.

62
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.480
I try to get involved with activities in
the here and now, because then it helps me

63
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.120
to control anxiety and
makes me more productive.

64
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.420
Now tell me what was your
best result within a company?

65
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.940
Any innovation you made?

66
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.540
That's a very easy one.

67
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.380
Arrive every day on time.

68
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.980
If you see my time card, impeccable.

69
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.860
That was the best result I
could deliver to a company.

70
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.280
Next.
Through the trainings I gave, it was very

71
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.160
interesting because we managed to increase
the retention of people in the classroom

72
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.760
by 70%, in addition to contributing to our
client's sales, with more assertive

73
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.500
trainings, according to the
reality of the salespeople.

74
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.060
Thinking now about the future, where
do you see yourself in a year's time?

75
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.180
About 5 years from now?

76
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.740
Guys, like this, you HR people
ask every clueless question.

77
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.940
Aren't you ashamed?

78
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.080
So, I don't even know if I'll be alive in
five years' time, buddy But just so you're

79
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.080
happy, and we can finish this interview
soon, I want to be rich, I want to earn on

80
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.020
the average scene so I
never have to work again.

81
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.820
I think that's a good answer.

82
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.800
I already see myself at a higher level in
my career, I intend to be a director, I

83
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.640
know there is a path for that, so I am
already preparing for this challenge And

84
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.780
also, as I said before, I want
to be a college professor.

85
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.920
So, to wrap it up, many competitors are

86
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.440
competing for this position I wanted you
to tell me what your differential is Why

87
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.780
our company should hire you Since you are
competing with so many people, right!

88
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.840
?

89
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.900
Wait, you said you have
a lot of applicants.

90
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.740
How many vacancies do you have to offer?

91
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.460
Sir, for God's sake, what do you mean?

92
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.480
You I'm already getting nervous, because I

93
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.300
need this job, you don't
understand, I'm full of debt!

94
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.000
I'm already in the SPC, I'm already in

95
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.260
Serasa For God's sake,
man, hire me I need it!

96
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.440
!
!

97
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.360
I think you should hire me because I am a
professional who already has experience in

98
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.200
other areas and I can contribute with this
more strategic vision I also really like

99
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.040
working in a team I don't like to retain
knowledge I think we have to come together

100
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.040
to do a good job and I will certainly
bring good results to the company.
